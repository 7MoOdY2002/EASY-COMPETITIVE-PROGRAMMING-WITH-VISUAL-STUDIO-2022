# EasyCPwithVS2022
How to easily have a project where you can compile multiple cpps (for competitve programming) using VS2022 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103985762/165746586-b8f354a5-59aa-487c-b44e-3d22dcb951aa.png" width="40" height="35" />

You create your new cpp file and start work with it (I mean to finsih your problem) üñ•Ô∏è

Here you can see how you create a new cpp file:

  -First go to Source files right click and press "Add" and "New item" or hit on your keyboard "CTRL+SHIFT+A"

After you finish up the problem (I hope it got accepted üíù) you set the property exclude from build to that cpp to "YES" and start to work on another problem 

To do that your right click the cpp in the explorer window, hit properties and set exclude from build to "YES"
